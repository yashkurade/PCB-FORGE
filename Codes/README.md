# Code Directory

Welcome to the beating heart of PCB F.O.R.G.E. — the code directory. Here lies the brainpower that drives our CNC soldering machine, carefully crafted and evolved from version 1 to version 8. Each version represents countless late nights, bug hunts, and moments of pure triumph.

## Evolution of Brilliance
- **v1:** Pi cam works! Yepeeeee! (We celebrated like we won the lottery.)
- **v2:** Detects solderpads — and only occasionally mistakes them for cookie crumbs.
- **v3:** Dashboard is running with 200 — because we finally did something right.
- **v4:** Dashboard is refined — now 20% less ugly.
- **v5:** Dashboard is refined x2 — we call this the glow-up version.
- **v6:** The version that made us believe — in miracles and working code.
- **v7:** Almost there, but not quite — still better than most beta releases.
- **v8:** The final boss — stable, efficient, and glorious. We dare you to find a bug.

## A Friendly Warning
This code is the product of sweat, creativity, and probably a little caffeine overdose. If you’re thinking of borrowing (or, ahem, stealing) this code, just remember:

- We’ve embedded a self-destruct sequence (we haven’t, but maybe we did). 
- Unauthorized use might summon the Hashira to hunt you down.
- At the very least, your devices may start playing Rick Astley on repeat.

So, feel free to learn and contribute — but tread carefully.

Happy coding!
