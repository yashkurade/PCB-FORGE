                Project Mentor<br><br>
                It all started with a simple idea — empowering small businesses and innovators
                to manufacture PCBs with professional-level precision without breaking the bank.
                Our goal was to create a cost-effective, efficient, and innovative solution that
                brings big capabilities to small-scale creators.

            <h2>YASH KURADE</h2>
            <p>
                Electronics Engineer (BE) 2025 Batch, VESIT<br><br>
                Ever since I chose electronics as my core branch, I knew I wanted to build something that wasn’t just a “project” — but a reflection of the practical knowledge I had gained. Hardware has always been my passion, and I wanted my major project to scream that passion loud and clear. I’ve always dreamed of creating a machine with a microprocessor at its core — just like how Iron Man’s arc reactor powers his entire suit. And with PCB F.O.R.G.E., I finally brought that vision to life using the Raspberry Pi Zero W.

                This project was more than just circuits and code — it was a journey. Managing a team, aligning our ideas, and giving constant updates to our mentor taught me so much beyond just technical skills. But honestly, it never felt like a burden because I had the most amazing team by my side. We worked together seamlessly, turning late-night brainstorming sessions into real, working solutions.

                A huge part of our success also goes to our mentor, who stood by us through every high and low. He never dismissed our ideas, no matter how ambitious — instead, he helped us refine and optimize them. His guidance gave us the freedom to explore, experiment, and innovate.
                <br><br>
                I also want to express my gratitude to the workshop faculty at our college. Their hands-on support — drilling, cutting, and shaping parts exactly as we envisioned — played a crucial role in bringing our design to reality.
                <br><br>
                Looking back, PCB F.O.R.G.E. isn’t just a machine — it’s a piece of my heart, my team’s hard work, and the collective support we received. And I couldn’t be more proud.
