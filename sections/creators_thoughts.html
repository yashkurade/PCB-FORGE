            <p>
                Electronics Engineer (BE) 2025 Batch, VESIT<br><br>
                Ever since I chose electronics as my core branch, I knew I wanted to build something that wasn’t just a “project” — but a reflection of the practical knowledge I had gained. Hardware has always been my passion, and I wanted my major project to scream that passion loud and clear. I’ve always dreamed of creating a machine with a microprocessor at its core — just like how Iron Man’s arc reactor powers his entire suit. And with PCB F.O.R.G.E., I finally brought that vision to life using the Raspberry Pi Zero W.

                This project was more than just circuits and code — it was a journey. Managing a team, aligning our ideas, and giving constant updates to our mentor taught me so much beyond just technical skills. But honestly, it never felt like a burden because I had the most amazing team by my side. We worked together seamlessly, turning late-night brainstorming sessions into real, working solutions.

                A huge part of our success also goes to our mentor, who stood by us through every high and low. He never dismissed our ideas, no matter how ambitious — instead, he helped us refine and optimize them. His guidance gave us the freedom to explore, experiment, and innovate.
                <br><br>
                I also want to express my gratitude to the workshop faculty at our college. Their hands-on support — drilling, cutting, and shaping parts exactly as we envisioned — played a crucial role in bringing our design to reality.
                <br><br>
                Looking back, PCB F.O.R.G.E. isn’t just a machine — it’s a piece of my heart, my team’s hard work, and the collective support we received. And I couldn’t be more proud.

              PCB F.O.R.G.E. is a celebration of what happens when passion meets purpose and technology meets tenacity. Built around the Raspberry Pi Zero W, this project became the physical manifestation of our shared vision—a machine that not only functioned but told a story of innovation and collaboration. It is a fusion of hardware and imagination that mirrored the ingenuity of a futuristic invention. What began as a spark of an idea evolved into a journey of discovery, where every soldered joint and every line of code carried the weight of our dedication. The process was far from easy, but it was in those moments of uncertainty that our team truly shone. The journey was a mosaic of late-night discussions, meticulous planning, and countless iterations, each step bringing us closer to our goal. What made it truly special was the synergy of our team, where every member brought unique perspectives and skills to the table.<br><br>
              Our mentor’s unwavering support and insightful feedback were the guiding lights that helped us navigate through challenges and refine our ideas. The workshop faculty’s precision and expertise turned our designs into reality, adding the final layer of perfection to our creation. 
              PCB F.O.R.G.E. is more than just a project; it’s a symbol of what can be achieved when minds come together with a shared purpose .It is not just a machine; it’s a story of resilience, innovation, and the unyielding belief that with passion and teamwork, even the wildest dreams can take shape.  It’s a reminder that the most extraordinary creations are born not just from technical skill, but from the courage to dream and the determination to bring those dreams to life.

                Electronics Engineer (BE) 2025 Batch, VESIT<br><br>
                Embarking on the PCB FORGE project—our endeavor to create an automatic soldering machine—has been a transformative journey, blending technical challenges with profound learning experiences. It began with the realization that automating the meticulous process of manual soldering could significantly enhance efficiency and precision. Our team delved into extensive research on existing soldering technologies, balancing complexity with functionality to design a machine tailored to our needs. <br><br>
                The construction phase tested our problem-solving skills, requiring ingenuity to procure components within budget constraints and ensure precise assembly. Programming the machine's operations was akin to composing a symphony, where timing and coordination were paramount. The prototyping phase presented challenges, but each setback prompted us to refine our approach. This journey underscored the power of collaboration, transforming challenges into opportunities and ideas into reality. In retrospect, PCB FORGE symbolizes more than an automatic soldering machine; it embodies our growth, the spirit of innovation, and the unyielding pursuit of excellence.

                Every great innovation starts with a problem waiting to be solved. For me, PCB F.O.R.G.E. wasn’t just about building a machine—it was about redefining how small-scale creators approach PCB manufacturing. I wanted to bridge the gap between professional-grade precision and accessible, cost-effective solutions. From the very start, I was fascinated by the intricate balance of hardware, software, and automation, and this project became the perfect playground to bring that fascination to life.
                The journey wasn’t without challenges. Designing a system that ensured both accuracy and efficiency demanded relentless testing, recalibration, and optimization. There were moments where the smallest misalignment meant reworking entire sections, but that’s where the real learning happened. Every hurdle became an opportunity to refine, improve, and push the limits of what we thought was possible. <br><br>
                What made this journey truly special was the fusion of ideas—every team member brought something unique to the table, and our mentor’s guidance helped us turn abstract concepts into tangible results. It wasn’t just about coding, circuits, or mechanics; it was about understanding how all these elements interact to create something greater than the sum of its parts.
                Looking back, PCB F.O.R.G.E. isn’t just a project—it’s a statement. A statement that innovation isn’t reserved for massive corporations, that with the right vision and perseverance, even students can create technology that makes a real impact. This experience didn’t just sharpen my technical skills; it reshaped my perspective on problem-solving, collaboration, and the endless possibilities of engineering. And that, to me, is what true innovation is all about.
