            <h2>The Spark of an Idea</h2>
            <p>
              Every big invention starts with a small idea — and so did PCB F.O.R.G.E. 
              It wasn’t born in a high-tech lab, but from a simple realization: small creators and 
              startups struggle to manufacture quality PCBs without spending a fortune. We knew there 
              had to be a better way. <br><br>
              Of course — just like Stark wanted his suits to stand out, 
              we wanted to build something that would be nothing short of extraordinary. 
              This wasn’t just any project — it was our major engineering project, and we knew it had to be innovative, 
              powerful, and something that truly pushed the boundaries of what we could create. 
              So we gave it everything we had — every bit of skill, creativity, and late-night hustle.

            <h2>The Cave Moment</h2>
            <p>
              Just like Tony Stark built his first suit with scraps in a cave, we started our journey with whatever we could get our hands on — old DVD stepper motors, a Raspberry Pi Zero W, and a whole lot of ambition. There was no high-end lab, no endless budget, just a small workspace cluttered with wires, tools, and big dreams.
              <br><br>
              What drove us wasn’t just the need to complete a major engineering project — it was the belief that we could build something that mattered. Every late-night brainstorming session, every failed circuit, and every spark of inspiration pushed us closer to that goal. There were moments when nothing worked, when the soldering iron felt like a weapon of mass destruction, and the motors refused to cooperate — but that’s what made the process real.
              <br><br>
              We improvised, adapted, and learned to make the most out of what we had. And slowly, piece by piece, PCB F.O.R.G.E. began to take form — not as a perfect machine right away, but as a reflection of our grit and determination. It wasn’t built in a sleek lab — it was forged in the fires of our collective passion, shaped by trial and error, and powered by the belief that we could create something revolutionary.

          <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
          <p>
            Traditional PCB manufacturing felt like dealing with a clunky, outdated system — slow, expensive, and frustrating. If you’re a small business, a startup, or just an electronics hobbyist, the hurdles are endless. You either wait weeks for your PCB to arrive, hoping there are no mistakes, or you shell out a ridiculous amount of money for fast prototyping. And if there’s one tiny error? You’re back to square one — more time, more money, more headaches.
            <br><br>
            We knew there had to be a better way. Imagine having an idea and bringing it to life without those delays — without breaking the bank. That’s where PCB F.O.R.G.E. comes in. We wanted to create a tool that empowers creators — one that gives you control over your own production, right from your workspace.
            <br><br>
            It wasn’t just about cutting costs — it was about freedom. The freedom to experiment, to innovate, and to iterate without waiting weeks or draining your budget. We wanted to bridge the gap between professional-grade PCB manufacturing and the everyday maker’s needs — and we knew that if we could pull it off, it would change everything.
            <br><br>
            This was the driving force behind PCB F.O.R.G.E. — not just a project, but a mission to democratize electronics manufacturing. Just like Stark built his suits to take control of his own fate, we built this machine to put the power back in the hands of innovators.
