            <h2>Upgrading Without Limits</h2>
            <p>
                One of the coolest things about PCB F.O.R.G.E. is its flexibility — we built it in a way that it's not tied down to any specific set of components. Right now, we used DVD stepper motors and a 5W soldering pen because they fit our budget and got the job done. But if we ever want to take precision and efficiency to the next level, we can easily upgrade to more powerful and accurate parts.

                Imagine swapping out the DVD motors for high-torque NEMA steppers or replacing the 5W soldering pen with a more advanced soldering station tip — the entire system is adaptable. 
                <br><br>
                This makes PCB F.O.R.G.E. a project that can grow with our needs and resources. Whether you're working on a tight budget or ready to go all out with professional-grade components, the foundation stays the same. And that’s one of the best features of this whole setup — its scalability.

            <h2>Expanding Beyond Soldering</h2>
            <p>
                PCB F.O.R.G.E. isn’t just limited to soldering — that’s just the beginning. The same CNC mechanism we built can be adapted for so much more. Imagine adding a small spindle motor, and boom — now it’s a PCB milling and drilling machine! Need perfect holes for through-hole components? We got that covered.

                But that’s not all. We’re also thinking of adding a solder paste or flux dispensing system. This would make SMD soldering a breeze — just apply the paste, place the components, and reflow. The potential here is massive, and with a few more tweaks, PCB F.O.R.G.E. could become a complete PCB manufacturing powerhouse.

          <h2>SMD Component Placement</h2>
          <p>
            One of the most exciting upgrades we see ahead is turning PCB F.O.R.G.E. into a full-fledged SMD pick-and-place machine. With a bit of modification, our existing CNC setup can easily handle precise component placement. Imagine a vacuum pickup tool attached to the same servo mechanism — it could pick tiny SMD resistors, capacitors, and ICs and place them perfectly on the solder pads we’ve already detected.

            This would take automation to the next level, eliminating the need for manual tweezers and shaky hands. Plus, combining this with solder paste dispensing and reflow capabilities? Now we’re talking about a complete end-to-end PCB assembly solution — all on a budget-friendly, customizable machine.
