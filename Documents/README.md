# Documents Directory  

Welcome to the most underrated yet most essential part of PCB F.O.R.G.E. — the Documents Directory. Think of this as the backstage area: no flashy lights, no stepper motors buzzing, just solid plans and paperwork that make the magic happen.  

## What’s Inside?  
Here lies the carefully crafted blueprints of this project — every brilliant idea and every late-night brainstorm preserved in text.  

- Project Proposal: Where the dream began — the vision, scope, and why the world needed PCB F.O.R.G.E.  
- Final Report: The full journey — from concept to execution, including technical deep dives and lessons learned.  
- Additional Docs: Diagrams, planning sheets, calculations, and any other important bits we cooked up along the way.  

## Why This Matters  
Every great invention starts with a great plan — and this is ours. If you want to understand the why and how behind the CNC soldering machine revolution, this is your reading material.  

So grab a coffee, dig in, and enjoy the paper trail behind the tech.
